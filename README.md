# Tutorials
Tutorials of approaches I found useful for my work.

Contains:
- Cumulative Link Mixed-effects Models (CLMMs) with the `ordinal` package in R [(Technical note for useR! 2021)](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/technical_notes/t186/technote/)
- Ordinal regressions in frequentist (with the `ordinal` package) and Bayesian (with the `brms` package) frameworks in R [(Tutorial given at the Konstanz School of Collective Behaviour 2023)](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/kscb/)
- K-means for time series in Python

*Note that I use the terms Cumulative link models and Ordinal regressions interchangeably.*
