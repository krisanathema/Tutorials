# Tutorials
Tutorials of approaches I found useful for my work.

Contains:
- Cumulative Link Mixed-effects Models (CLMMs) with ordinal package in R [(Technical note for useR! 2021)](https://user2021.r-project.org/participation/technical_notes/t186/technote/)
- Ordinal regressions in frequentist (with ordinal package) and Bayesian (with brms package) frameworks in R
- K-means for time series in Python

Note that I use the terms Cumulative link models and Ordinal regressions interchangeably.
